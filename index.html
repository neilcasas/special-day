                                    Here's the highlight of the date! Based on my research, the Mind Museum is a perfect
                                    combination between science and fun, with all sorts of cool exhibitions that are all
                                    interactive. There's also a dinosaur, and this metal ball that can make your hair
                                    rise up. Isn't that cool?

                                    Here's another museum that we could go to. It's all fancy-shmancy, considering that
                                    its totally not copying a certain museum in New York (or maybe its related to the
                                    Met, I'm not really judging) But really, it's full of contemporary art created by
                                    local artists and the vibes are just immaculate on this one.

                                    I will be making a habit of that from now on). We don't have to limit ourselves to
                                    the two aforementioned museums, we can go wherever in BGC. Because being with you is
                                    already more than enough for me, and I love taking pictures of you because you are
                                    the most beautiful woman in the entire world.
